# Compatibility

DSH Mobile speaks the DeepSeek Harness **web client protocol** (the JSON-RPC
surface the harness GUI itself consumes over `/api`). That protocol is internal
to the harness and is not versioned on the wire, so this app pins a protocol
baseline: the harness release its DTOs and call shapes were ported from and
checked against.

| DSH Mobile | Harness version | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0.12.0 | 0.1.7-rc.2 (tag `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2`, `477b4f420553e8a52c2fbccc464d7561b239c443`); still reads 0.1.6-alpha.x | Current target. See [What 0.1.7 changed](#what-017-changed) |
| 0.11.6 – 0.11.7 | 0.1.6-alpha.1 + master `0d1f50007f9bca3f52b06e1c3074fa14d5fb0720`; also checked against `0.1.6-alpha.2` | Against 0.1.7: every tool card loses its result, the preset roster fails to decode, the subagent sheet and Jobs card stay empty, image and PDF previews fail, and archiving a running session silently does nothing |
| 0.11.5 | 0.1.6-alpha.1 + master `0d1f50007f9bca3f52b06e1c3074fa14d5fb0720`; also checked against `0.1.6-alpha.2` | First release whose wire surface is checked against a *running* harness rather than against a description of one — see [Automated conformance](#automated-conformance) |
| 0.11.4 | 0.1.6-alpha.1 + master `0d1f50007f9bca3f52b06e1c3074fa14d5fb0720` | The queue dock is empty against a harness at or past the commit that removed `session/control`'s `queues` map; PTC dispatch metadata renders as raw rows in the transcript |
| 0.11.3 | 0.1.6-alpha.1 + master `0d1f50007f9bca3f52b06e1c3074fa14d5fb0720` | Every answered, dismissed or skipped question card sticks: the host never tells the answering client its request resolved, and the card waited for that frame |
| 0.11.1 – 0.11.2 | 0.1.6-alpha.1 + master `0d1f50007f9bca3f52b06e1c3074fa14d5fb0720` | Question answers and approvals are refused by any harness ≥ 0.1.2: `$events/result` was posted without its `args` wrapper |
| 0.11.0 | 0.1.6-alpha.1 + master `0d1f50007f9bca3f52b06e1c3074fa14d5fb0720` | See [validation](VALIDATION-0.11.0.md) |
| 0.10.1 | 0.1.3-alpha.1 | Previous baseline |
| 0.10.0 | 0.1.3-alpha.1 | |
| 0.9.3 | 0.1.2-alpha.1 | Previous baseline — no streaming on 0.1.3, commands refused |
| 0.9.2 | 0.1.2-alpha.1 | Cannot send messages |
| 0.9.1 | 0.1.2-alpha.1 | Cannot send messages |
| 0.9.0 | 0.1.2-alpha.1 | Cannot send messages |
| 0.8.0 | 0.1.1-rc.2 | |
| 0.7.0 | 0.1.1-rc.2 | |

| 0.5.0 | 0.1.0-rc.8 | |
| 0.4.0 | 0.1.0-rc.7 | |
| 0.1.0 – 0.3.1 | 0.1.0-rc.5 | |

**0.10.0 and 0.9.x do not interchange.** A 0.9.x app connects to a 0.1.3
harness and reads history, but it never sees a reply being written — session
format v2 logs no per-token events and the app does not ask for the live
stream that replaced them — and every slash command is refused, because the
argument that carries attachments was renamed. A 0.10.0 app against a 0.1.2
harness is the mirror image: it asks `session/follow` for a stream 0.1.2 does
not know and sends `commands/execute` an argument 0.1.2 does not declare.
Upgrade both, or neither.

**0.9.0 does not speak the 0.1.1 protocol** either; that break was at the
handshake rather than partway through a session (see 0.9.0 in the changelog).

## Current-master scope

From 0.12.0 the target is a tagged release again (`dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2`), so the tag and the
commit name the same thing. 0.11.x targeted 0.1.6-alpha.1 plus master at the commit above,
inspected on September 15, 2026. 0.12.0 keeps reading the 0.1.6 shapes where it can tell
them apart on the wire, but its conformance runs are against rc.2. Optional endpoints may be unavailable in a
particular host composition; failures remain visible and unknown event payloads remain
inspectable. Host-owned model adapters, SSH, MCP, Browser/Computer Use, subprocesses and
session-log migrations remain in the harness.

## Relay

Reaching a harness through [`dsh-relay`](https://github.com/sorsama/deepseek-harness-relay)
is a separate contract with its own version, because the relay is a plugin
mounted beside the harness rather than part of it.

| DSH Mobile | [dsh-relay](https://github.com/sorsama/deepseek-harness-relay) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.11.5 – 0.12.0 | 0.2.1 | As 0.11.4. From 0.12.0 `workspaceFiles/readBytes` answers as multipart/form-data, which the relay passes through as it does any body |
| 0.11.0 – 0.11.4 | 0.2.1 | As 0.10.x. From 0.11.2 the `Host` header brackets an IPv6 literal, without which the relay's fence refuses every `/api` call as `unparsable-host` |
| 0.10.0 – 0.10.1 | 0.2.1 | Pairing payload `v: 1`; mDNS TXT `v: 1`. File uploads need the relay to proxy `/api/session/uploadFileBinary`, or the app falls back to the `fileUploads/upload` Remote |
| 0.9.2 – 0.9.3 | 0.2.1 | |
| 0.9.1 | 0.2.1 | |
| 0.9.0 | 0.2.0 | |
| 0.8.0 | 0.1.1 | |

A relay older than 0.2.0 cannot serve a 0.1.2 or later harness at all. The
harness authenticates its whole `/api` surface against a browser-session
cookie, and the relay deliberately strips the client's `Cookie` header before
forwarding — so every proxied request is answered 401 until the relay supplies
a harness session of its own. That is a relay change, not an app one.

A relay build that lacks the session signing fails the same way whatever its
version says. **`dsh-relay` 0.2.1 as published to npm is one**: the tarball was
packed from a stale build, so pairing succeeds and every proxied call — both mux
upgrades included — comes back 401
([deepseek-harness-relay#6](https://github.com/sorsama/deepseek-harness-relay/pull/6)).
Install it from source instead,
`dsh plugin --profile web add github:sorsama/deepseek-harness-relay#v0.2.1`, or
any later release that carries the fix. The app reports this as the harness
refusing the relay, not as a pairing problem (see `docs/PROTOCOL.md`).

Both versions are checked, unlike the harness baseline. A pairing payload is a
credential exchange, so a `kind` other than `dsh-relay-pair` or a `v` above the
one this build understands is refused outright rather than degraded — see
`docs/PROTOCOL.md`. Everything *behind* the relay is the harness protocol
unchanged, so the version policy below applies to it exactly as before.

The baseline is one constant — `DshCore.PROTOCOL_BASELINE` in
`core/src/main/kotlin/com/labteto/dshmobile/core/DshCore.kt` — and the app shows
it in Settings → About next to its own version.

## Automated conformance

From 0.11.5 there is a `:conformance` module that boots a real harness from a checkout, exchanges a
launch token for a browser session, and drives the shipped client against it. It is opt-in — it
skips unless `DSH_HARNESS_SRC` names a built checkout — so ordinary CI is unchanged:

```sh
DSH_HARNESS_SRC=/path/to/deepseek-harness ./gradlew :conformance:test
```

What it establishes today, against `0.1.7-rc.2` (and, before 0.12.0, against `0.1.6-alpha.2`):

- the launch-token exchange really does buy a session, and that session really does open `/api` —
  a tier `mock-harness` cannot model, because it implements no `GET /?token=` at all;
- an unauthenticated call is a 401 and reads as a missing session, not as a broken connection;
- `$events` opens with a `ready` frame carrying a usable `clientId` and host home;
- **every endpoint this client calls is understood by the harness** — the gateway matches args
  against the host method's own parameter names, exactly, so a rename or a moved shape is a refusal
  the test sees immediately;
- work waiting behind a busy agent reaches the queue dock through the `inbox` projection;
- the streams the app opens beyond `$events` and `session/control` (`job/list`, `job/follow`,
  per-file `workspaceFiles/changes`, `workspace/follow`) accept its arguments;
- a file read through `workspaceFiles/readBytes` comes back byte for byte through the multipart
  answer, as a whole file, a window, and relative to another file;
- a real tool-calling turn (the harness's own mock model, no key) folds to a tool call and a
  result that pair, which is the session format v4 check.

Checks against rc.2 need the mock model to speak the Messages API, which rc.2's mock does; the
suite stops writing `llm-deepseek: {protocol: chat-completions}` when the checkout's adapter
refuses that setting.

What it does not yet cover, and what the older caveats still apply to: live assistant streaming,
tool approvals, question answering against the real acceptance law, attachments, and message
feedback on a freshly generated reply. The machinery for all of them is in place — the harness's
own scriptable model server drives a real turn without a paid key — so these are additions rather
than open questions about feasibility.

## Version policy

The baseline says what was tested. It is not a gate, and the app does not warn
when it reaches a harness built from a different commit — it could not say what
would break if it did. The harness releases far more often than this client.

Through 0.1.1 the app could at least *read* the harness's version, from
`host.describe`. It cannot any more: 0.1.2 removed that call and publishes no
version anywhere on the wire. So the connect list, the details panel and
Settings → Harness show the host's home directory — the one host fact the
`ready` frame still carries — and About shows this client's own pinned
baseline, which is a statement about the app rather than about the harness it
is talking to.

What the app does:

- **Degrades on shape, not on version.** Unknown event types, stream frame
  kinds, tool cards and content blocks fall back to passthroughs rather than
  failing, and unknown keys are ignored. A build that composes no such capability
  answers 404, which the client reads as "this build does not offer that" and
  hides the control instead of reporting a failure.
- **Has no version-shaped branch.** There used to be exactly one: through
  0.1.1, `commands/execute` took a required `images` argument only from
  0.1.0-rc.8, and the client chose its shape from a field only rc.8 emitted.
  0.1.2 deleted that signal, and 0.1.3 renamed the argument again — this time
  the client simply moved with it, because a 0.1.3 host refuses the old key
  and a 0.1.2 host refuses the new one, and there is nothing on the wire to
  choose by.
- **Re-checks on each harness release** with the fixture capture tool
  (`tools/capture`), and moves the baseline once the shapes have been verified.

## What 0.1.7 changed

Session format v4, plus several endpoints moved onto projections and streams.
`docs/PROTOCOL.md` has the shapes under "0.12.0 contract additions"; this is the summary.

- **Tool results are tool-role messages.** The call id and error flag moved off the
  `tool-result` wrapper and onto the message. A client that reads the wrapper pairs no result
  with its call, which is what 0.11.x does against 0.1.7.
- **A new durable event, `developer/message`,** records the agent's tool set changing.
- **Subagents** come from the parent's `subagentCatalog` projection; `subagents/list` is gone.
- **Jobs** moved off `session/control` onto `job/list`, with `job/follow` and `job/kill`
  beside it.
- **Binary file reads** are one call, `workspaceFiles/readBytes` with `options`, answered as
  multipart/form-data; `readAll` and `readRelated` are gone, and the file watch names a path.
- **Archiving** a session with running work is refused unless the request asks to stop it.
- **Pins**, a localized approval reason, and a smaller preset roster (no `authorable`, no
  `trust`, no authoring calls).
- **The DeepSeek adapter** speaks only the Messages API and refuses a `protocol` setting; this
  affects the conformance harness, not the app.

0.12.0 reads both generations: the fold accepts v3 and v4 tool results, the jobs card listens to
both sources, the subagent sheet falls back to `subagents/list`, and file reads repeat the 0.1.6
call when the host refuses `options`. None of it depends on a version string.

## What 0.1.3 changed

Session format v2, plus generic file uploads. `docs/PROTOCOL.md` carries the
shapes; this is the summary.

- **No durable deltas.** `assistant/chunk` is gone from the log. Each model
  attempt settles as one event — an `assistant/message` when it produced a
  surface message, a new log-only `assistant/attempt` when it did not — and the
  settlement embeds the exact compact stream the attempt produced. A 0.1.3 host
  no longer sends the packed `chunks` history record 0.1.2 introduced, because
  there is nothing left to pack; the app still reads that record when a 0.1.2
  host sends one, since misreading it opens a sequence gap.
- **Streaming is opt-in and process-local.** A `session/follow` request that
  sets `assistantStream: true` receives `assistant-stream` frames (`start`,
  `chunk`, `end`) beside the durable events, and its opening snapshot carries an
  `assistantStream` baseline describing any attempt caught mid-stream. These
  frames are presentation, never replayed and never paged; the app folds them
  into a provisional message that the settlement replaces.
- **Every business error code is namespaced.** `attachment-error` became
  `session/attachment-invalid`, `agent-busy` became `session/agent-busy`,
  `session-not-found` became `session/not-found`, and the gateway's own
  refusals — which used to arrive as a bare `internal` — carry codes of their
  own: `gateway/arguments-invalid`, `gateway/input-invalid` (the boundary
  validation of a `request` object), `gateway/bad-request`, `gateway/internal`.
- **Commands carry attachments, not images.** The third argument of
  `commands/execute` is `submittedAttachments`, each member tagged
  `{type: "image", …}` or `{type: "file", receiptId}`, and a descriptor
  declares `input.attachments` where it declared `input.images`.
- **Files.** Any file can be staged for a session, either by streaming its
  bytes to `POST /api/session/uploadFileBinary` or through the
  `fileUploads/upload` Remote, and cited from a prompt or a command by the
  receipt the upload answered with. A stored file appears in the log as a
  `file` content block carrying its name, size and digest.
- **Subagent prompts take prompt parts.** `subagents/prompt` `content` is the
  same `PromptContentPart` vocabulary `session/prompt` takes, so a follow-up to
  a child may carry images (files are refused for a child).
- **The mux heartbeat has a deadline.** The host terminates a socket that
  misses two pings; the platform answers pongs, so nothing changes here.

## What 0.1.2 changed

The whole `/api` surface moved. `packages/host/apiproxy` was deleted upstream
and every operation now belongs to the business service that owns it, so this is
a summary rather than an exhaustive list.

- **Method names.** `domain.method` became `namespace/method`
  (`session.list` → `session/list`). Several calls that took a request object now
  take flat named arguments, because the gateway matches an args object against
  the host method's *parameter names*.
- **Prompts carry an identity.** `session/prompt` and `subagents/prompt` gained a
  required `requestId`, minted by the sender, one per human message; the host
  persists it on the message the prompt is accepted as.
- **One socket.** `/api/events.mux` and `/api/events.host` were replaced by
  `/api/remote.mux`, which multiplexes independently cancellable logical
  streams and, unlike its predecessors, is written to as well as read.
- **Readiness.** `host.describe` is gone. A connection is ready when the
  Gateway-internal `$events` stream yields its opening `ready` frame.
- **Answers.** `/api/respond` is gone. Approvals and questions arrive as
  agent-scoped waterfalls on `$events` and are answered through
  `$events/result`, bound to the generation by its `clientId`. That endpoint is
  an ordinary Remote, so the answer rides in the usual `args` object like every
  other unary — a bare payload is refused. The answering client is told nothing
  further: the host drops its delivery before cancelling the rest, so a receipt
  is the only sign that card is done.
- **History is a stream.** `session.history` became `session/follow` (a stream
  opening with a complete snapshot) plus `session/page` (a unary read that
  *requires* the follow generation's cursor).
- **Tool cards are the client's.** The host no longer computes render intents;
  terminal, diff, read, search and web cards are derived in the app from the raw
  call, result and durable `meta`.
- **Authentication.** See below.

## Authentication

Since harness 0.1.2 the complete `/api` surface — every call, the mux upgrade,
the session-log download and, since 0.1.3, the file-upload route — is
authenticated against a signed browser-session cookie. The harness prints a
launch token once per process; `GET /?token=…` exchanges it for a host-only,
`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie. The token is rejected on `/api` paths and
in an `Authorization` header, so the index route is the only exchange point.

A request that clears the `Host`/`Origin` checks but carries no session is
answered **401**, which is a different fact from the **403** those checks
produce, and the app reports them separately: a 403 is about where the request
came from and is fixed on the harness, a 401 is about who is asking and is fixed
by exchanging a token.

Behind a relay this is the relay's business — it holds the harness session and
injects it upstream, and the phone never carries the host's cookie across the
network.

## Loopback-only surfaces

There are none any more.

Through 0.1.1 the harness kept a `PRIVILEGED_METHODS` list — `settings.*`,
`credentials.*`, `llm.discoverModels`, `host.pickDirectory`, `host.openPath`,
and agent-preset authoring — that it refused to non-loopback callers with 403,
and this app presented those surfaces read-only or hidden. 0.1.2 **deleted that
list**. There is one uniform authenticated tier: possession of a browser session
authorizes the complete tool-capable API, which is the same authority the web
app has after creating a session.

This is a real change in posture, not an editorial one. A paired device now
reaches settings and credentials where it previously got a refusal.

Nothing in the app branches on it — these surfaces already degraded on 403 and
404 rather than on a stored flag, so a paired device simply starts getting
answers. What decides who reaches them is now entirely the relay's
`privilegedMethods` policy, which is the relay's own rule rather than a mirror
of the harness's.

## Known differences by harness release

- **Image bounds are the host's.** 0.1.1-rc.2 raised the shipped admission caps
  (per-image 3.5MB → 20MB, per-message 100MB → 200MB, 40M → 64M pixels,
  2000px → 8192px per side). The app enforces whatever the `imageLimits`
  projection says and falls back to those defaults when a host publishes none.
- **Stored images are normalized on ingest.** The attachment reference describes
  the re-encoded stored image: its `mediaType` can differ from the upload's,
  `attachmentId` is the digest of the normalized bytes, animated GIFs flatten to
  one frame, and `originalDimensions` reports the upload's pixel size when
  scaling occurred. The client treats the reference as opaque.
- **Stored files are verbatim.** A file is kept byte for byte with no
  normalization, and its `attachmentId` is the sha256 of exactly those bytes.
  The app renders a file as a chip — name and size — and never downloads it;
  the bytes are for the agent's file tools.
- **Live and replayed transcripts differ in encoding, not content.** A reply
  arrives as `assistant-stream` frames while it is written and as one
  settlement event on reconnect or page; the fold shows the same message either
  way, and a reconnect mid-answer restores the partial text from the baseline.
